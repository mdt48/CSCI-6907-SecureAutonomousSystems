# **Report 1 - Marshall Thompson**

## **Introduction**
All plots had many data points and were often very compressed, making the alternations in speed, acceleration and heading imperceivable. Therefore I have included both the orginal graphs, and graphs of a subset of the data to make the oscillations in the data clear. 

## **Part 1**

## **Part 2**

There are a couple of differences between the plots for the genuine care and the attacker car. For the genuine car, the changes in speed, acceleration, and heading are constant or occur at regular intervals. This is in contrast to the random movements of the attacker car. They occur at random intervals and with random magnitudes. Furthermore, the random attacker moved more in the time period than the genuine car.

## **Part 4**

The same observations made in part 3 are true here as well. The attacker by definition is random, and therefore has many random movements, accelerations, and headings while all movements by the genuine car are consistent and periodic. The change in the attack parameters did not have much of an effect on the graphs. There are small changes, however there is nothing significant that I observed
